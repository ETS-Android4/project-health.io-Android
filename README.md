We have Created a Entire System that will Monitor and Update in Real-Time the availability of Medical Infrastructures like Hospitals, Ventilators, Oxygen Cylinders and hundreds of more amenities in our locality as well as all over country.

We have build multiple Solutions ranging From Android apps for users to have data on their fingertips to Large Data-Bases System that will be monitored by Government to perform proper Analysis of data and take accurate decision on time. 

If this system is implemented, It will revolutionize  the Medical facilitation of our country.
